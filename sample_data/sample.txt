The Job Scheduler Project

A distributed job scheduling system that accepts tasks from users,
decides which job should run next using pluggable scheduling policies,
and executes them concurrently in a multithreaded worker pool.

Supported scheduling policies:
- First Come First Served (FCFS): jobs run in arrival order
- Shortest Job First (SJF): shortest estimated duration runs first
- Priority Queue: highest priority (lowest number) runs first
- Round Robin: each job gets a fair time slice

The system handles failures gracefully with configurable retry logic
and a dead-letter queue for permanently failed jobs. Every job goes
through a well-defined lifecycle: PENDING, SCHEDULED, RUNNING,
COMPLETED, FAILED, or RETRIED.

Built with Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker.
This is not a toy project. These are real infrastructure patterns
used by systems like Celery, Sidekiq, and AWS SQS at scale.
